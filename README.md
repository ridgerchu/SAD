## Introduction

Spiking Autonomous Driving (SAD) is the first end-to-end autonomous driving system built entirely with Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs). It integrates perception, prediction, and planning modules into a unified neuromorphic framework.

### Key Features

- End-to-end SNN architecture for autonomous driving, integrating perception, prediction, and planning
- Perception module constructs spatio-temporal Bird's Eye View (BEV) representation from multi-view cameras using SNNs
- Prediction module forecasts future states using a novel dual-pathway SNN
- Planning module generates safe trajectories considering occupancy prediction, traffic rules, and ride comfort
- Achieves performance comparable to SOTA ANN methods on nuScenes with substantially lower energy consumption

## Modules

### Perception

The perception module constructs a spatio-temporal BEV representation from multi-camera inputs. The encoder uses sequence repetition, while the decoder employs sequence alignment.

### Prediction

The prediction module utilizes a dual-pathway SNN, where one pathway encodes past information and the other predicts future distributions. The outputs from both pathways are fused.

### Planning

The planning module optimizes trajectories using Spiking Gated Recurrent Units (SGRUs), taking into account static occupancy, future predictions, comfort, and other factors.

## Get Started
